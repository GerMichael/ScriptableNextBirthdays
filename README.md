## üõ† Setup

1. Download the Scriptable app from the [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/scriptable/id1405459188) for iPhones and iPads. For mac you have to install the latest build of the beta version from the official website ([https://scriptable.app/mac-beta/](https://scriptable.app/mac-beta/)).
2. Create a new script inside the app and paste the code from ScriptableNextBirthdays.js
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Run it one time **inside the app**. You may have to provide access to the contacts.
   _Reason for this step: To execute the script as widget, a precomputed and cached list of all birthdays has to be used due to memory limitations. Note: If you update the contacts, you have to sync the cache by executing the script in the app again!_
4. Add a new widget of the size you prefer to the homescreen and select Scriptable as source.
5. Select the script you've created just some seconds ago in the config-panel!
6. _(Optional: Adjust the settings in the script, see the documentation below)_

Enjoy the widget! üéÅ

## üö® FAQ

<details><summary><h3>Contact synchronisation doesn't work</h3></summary>

Since the Contact API used by this script provides very rich information about your contactts, the memory limitations were exceeded quite fast. To bypass this issue, a chache file gets created/updated on every execution in the app, since the app is not affected by this. To reflect your contact changes also in the widget, just re-execute the script in the app.
